## Setup
See [this](/Pi/README.md) for Raspberry Pi setup instructions.

Make sure you have [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install dependencies. (Feel free to use a *virtualenv* if you care)

I use Heroku to host and run this, while the Pi app runs locally.
(Follow [this guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python#introduction) to set up your own.)
